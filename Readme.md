# Fog Gate Randomizer for Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin

A simple program that randomizes fog gate destinations in *Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin*.

## Features

- Randomizes all the fog gate destinations.
- Not tested with any other mods.
- Randomizes only the fog gates and not the warps in the game like Giant Memories.

## Some Thing to Note

- Boss fights will not activate unless you enter the area around the Entrance gate (Some will require you to be extremely close to fog door) not the exit gate.
- Some boss will attack you but you will not be able to attack them unless they are activated. To activate read above point.
- Try looking for different ways around the map like dropdowns and reverse traversal to find new paths.
- Should be possible to finish the game and reach all places. Report with the seed if you discover any softlocks and bugs.
- Cheatsheet is located at (GameFolder)/mod/log

## Installation

- Copy the contents of the zip file to the game folder that contains DarkSoulsII.exe

## Usage
